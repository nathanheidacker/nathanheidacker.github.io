Publishing an Algorithm
=======================

Publishing an algorithm with AlphaGradient is easy! There are a few criteria that must be satisfied before an algorithm will be reviewed

Criteria:
    #. The algorithm must be type annotated with no errors
    #. All non-private and non-dunder methods must be thoroughly documented, following standard rst, google, or numpy docstring format.
    #. The algorithm must include an rst file containing documentation which thoroughly explains it. To see exactly how this document should be structured, please see the :ref:`algorithm template <algolib.template>`

Once these criteria have been met, please send an email to `alphagradientdev@gmail.com <alphagradientdev@gmail.com>`_ containing two files...
    #. The .py file containing your type-annotated, documented algorithm
    #. The .rst file containing all of the structured documentation for your algorithm

Thats it! Once you've submitted your algorithm, we will let your know of the status after a short review process. If there are any lingering issues that need to be ironed out before approval, we will respond as quickly as we can and try to get them sorted out. If your algorithm has been approved, it will be included in the next official AlphaGradient release as part of the `algolib` module, and the documentation will be updated to reflect its presence.
