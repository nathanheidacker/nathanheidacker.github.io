Non-Standard Algorithms
=======================

This page contains algorithms which do not fit the criteria of the standard category in some fashion. They either operate out of non-standard financial markets (eg. virtual exchanges, video game economies) or deal primarily with asset classes that are **not** familiar to the majority of traders (eg. highly custom assets). Algorithms in this section could really pertain to anything--be sure to read documentation thoroughly.
