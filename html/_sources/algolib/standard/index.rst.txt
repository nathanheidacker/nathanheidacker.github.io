Standard Algorithms
===================

This page contains algorithms that are 'standard', in that they operate within standard financial exchanges and use almost exclusively asset classes which are either contained in the standard asset library or derivative of those assets with minimal changes. Most of the algorithms in this section of the library operate on United States financial markets.
